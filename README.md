# Base64 Encoder

## Guided project from Ch.4 of "Introduction to Zig"

This is a simple base64 encoder/decoder written in Zig to help understand what it takes to convert binary data to text and back. I followed the guided project found [chapter 4](https://pedropark99.github.io/zig-book/Chapters/01-base64.html) of the book titled [Introduction to Zig](https://pedropark99.github.io/zig-book/) by Pedro Duarte Faria.
